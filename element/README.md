# Element for Franz:

This is not the official Franz recipe for Element (client for matrix.org).
Created for own use.

## Technology:

Element is built with the Matrix React SDK,[23] which is a React-based software development kit to ease the development of Matrix clients. Element is reliant on web technologies and uses Electron for bundling the app for Windows, MacOS and Linux. The Android and iOS clients are developed and distributed with their respective platform tools.
